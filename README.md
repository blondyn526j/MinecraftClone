# MinecraftClone
Yet Another Attempt in cloning Minecraft. For educational puproses.

This is my fist project using OpenGl
I did many, many things incorrectly, but I don't really want to rewrite it.
Everything was done for educational purposes only.

Also I'm using library FastNoise which you can find here:
